Evolution. Data Science. Video Games. Horror Fiction.

I am a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho, and the cofounder of [Polymorphic Games](http://www.polymorphicgames.com), an experimental video game studio that applies game development technology to scientific research and education. We have released two evolutionary video games on Steam:

[Darwin's Demons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/572020/Darwins_Demons/) is an rcade style space shooter in which you battle a population of evolving aliens. The alien's morphology, fire type, and behaviors are all encoded by a digital genome. The aliens that are best able to shoot or evade you reproduce to make the next generation.

[Project Hastur](https://store.steampowered.com/app/800700/Project_Hastur/) is an evolutionary tower defense game. Defend humanity against the ever changing threat of the alien Proteans. Project Hastur combines elements of 3D tower defense and real-time strategy with models of biological evolution to create a uniquely challenging experience.

I am also a huge Horror and Science Fiction nerd, and am fascinated by the intersection of these genres with science.
