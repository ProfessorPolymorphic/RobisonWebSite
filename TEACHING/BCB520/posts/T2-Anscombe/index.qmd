## MORE QUARTO!

Do the summary statistics reveal the truth?  Or are they **FILLED WITH LIES**?  A simple demonstration with Anscombe's Quartet.

# ANSCOMBE'S QUARTET

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate how summary statistics can sometimes be misleading and how data visualization helps us understand our dataset.

## The Data

Anscombe's Quartet is comprised of four pairs of x,y data:

```{r}
#| output: false
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
datasets::anscombe
```

## Example Hypotheses

1. Eric has four replicates in which he is measuring the expression of two proteins (x, y) on 11 samples.
2. Cody has four replicates in which he is measuring gene expression of two genes (x, y) in 11 cell images.
3. Ronald has four replicates in which he is measuring a blood protein (x) and a malaria marker (y) in 11 patients.

**Your hypothesis is that the four replicates do not differ in the correlation between x and y.**

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
tidy_anscombe <- anscombe %>%
 pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
              names_to = c(".value", "set"),
              names_pattern = "(.)(.)")
tidy_anscombe_summary <- tidy_anscombe %>%
  group_by(set) %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = lst(min,max,median,mean,sd,var),
                   .names = "{col}_{fn}"))
#> `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

vars<-c("set", "x_mean", "x_var",  "y_mean", "y_var")
thing<- as.data.frame(tidy_anscombe_summary[vars])
knitr::kable(thing)
```

## Visualization reveals hidden patterns!

```{r}
ggplot(tidy_anscombe,
       aes(x = x,
           y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = tidy_anscombe_summary, aes(x=x_mean, y = y_mean, color = "red", size = 5),
             show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~set) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
