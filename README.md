# RobisonWebSite

This repository serves as my professional website, where I describe my teaching, and research activities as a Professor and Institute Director at the University of Idaho.  I've developed the project using Posit's [Quarto](www.quarto.org) framework, which I find to be a very powerful way to combine html development, data science instruction, and blogging.

The sections in the website are pretty standard:

RESEARCH: is where I describe my current and past scholarly activities, along with a current list of my publications.
TEACHING: is where I keep the websites for all my courses, including Data Visualization and Communicating with Data.  I'm currently using Quarto's BLOG functionality to organize lectures, assignments, resources, and tutorials as listing pages.
