This repository serves as my professional website, where I describe my teaching, and research activities as a Professor and Institute Director at the University of Idaho.  I've developed the project using Posit's [Quarto](www.quarto.org) framework, which I find to be a very powerful way to combine html development, data science instruction, and blogging.
