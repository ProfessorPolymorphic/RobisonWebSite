## AGENDA

1.  Development goals for Outbreak Simulator.
2.  Conference opportunities (March to August).
3.  Development goals for the twin stick evolutionary sheep guarding slime game.
4.  Possible additional hires (Programmer and UI/UX).
5.  Preliminary thoughts for the Yeast Evolution collaboration with Syracuse.

## OUTBREAK SIMULATOR

There are lots of looming opportunities related to this project, and we need to set up this semester's burn down list and timeline.

### Relevant dates include:

-   January 30, 2023: Deadline to submit an application (4 pages) for an interactive demo to ISLS meeting in Montreal (June 13-17).

-   March 19-22, 2023: Tickbase Annual Meeting, Lake Tahoe, NV.

-   May 17-18, 2023: [Workshop on Simulation Games for Global Pandemic Resilience](SanteFeWorkshop.qmd), Santa Fe Institute, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

-   July 2023: SEPA Resubmission likely.

### Development needs:

1.  Airports / Air travel.
2.  Simple build with pre/post tests installed.
3.  Simple build that writes simulation session data to a csv.
4.  Headless mode for cluster deployment.
5.  Performance optimization.
6.  UI/UX Improvements ([Timeline from Elisha](OSTime.qmd)).
7.  Additional interventions (movement restrictions).
8.  Additional scenarios.
9.  Model testing (movement and infection).
10. Globe model implementation.
11. Touchscreen implementation.
12. BLOG / Youtube posts.
13. Model creator.

## TWIN STICK DEV GOALS

## POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL HIRES

1.  Programmer
2.  UI/UX

## YEAST COEVOLUTION

This is a funded grant to Dave Althoff and Kari Seagraves at Syracuse University. We have a subcontract (\~\$200k) for development of educational games related to yeast coevolution.
