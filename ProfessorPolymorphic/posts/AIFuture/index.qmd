## HISTORICAL PATTERNS

![](us-employment-share2.jpg)

## AUTOMATION OF HUMAN PHYSICAL LABOR

### The value of human labor = production/cost.

[Force Multiplier:]{.red} An external tool or resource that allows you to do more work with less effort.^[The term originally comes from the military context, but it has been widely adopted in business, technology, and other fields to describe a factor that dramatically amplifies the effectiveness of a group or system.]

[Outsourcing:]{.red}  Outsourcing refers to the business practice of contracting out certain tasks or functions to third-party service providers instead of performing them in-house. One of the primary reasons companies outsource is to achieve cost reductions. Labor, infrastructure, or operational costs might be lower in another location or with a specialized provider.

### What are common features of the sectors that displaced Agriculuture and Manufacturing?

1.  The tasks are [Place Bound]{.red}.
2.  The sectors feature a lot of [Knowledge Work]{.red}.

## KNOWLEDGE WORK? 

Knowledge work ^["Knowledge Work" is a term coined by Peter Drucker in his 1959 book "Landmarks of Tomorrow."] involves jobs and tasks that are primarily information-based and [Cognitive]{.red} in nature :

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Characteristics

1. **Intellectual Activity**: It involves thinking, analyzing, and processing information more than manual labor.
2. **Non-routine**: Unlike many traditional jobs, knowledge work doesn't necessarily follow a set script or routine. It often involves problem-solving, decision-making, and creative thinking.
3. **Information-based**: The main tools of a knowledge worker are information and knowledge, as opposed to physical tools or machinery.
4. **Driven by Expertise**: Knowledge workers often have specific areas of expertise, education, or training that they draw upon to do their jobs.
5. **Autonomy**: Knowledge workers often have a degree of autonomy in terms of how they approach and solve problems. This autonomy is due to the non-routine nature of their tasks.
6. **Continuous Learning**: The dynamic nature of information and the fields in which knowledge workers operate necessitates continuous learning and adaptation.
7. **Outcome-focused**: The value of knowledge work is often measured by outcomes or results rather than the hours worked.

### Examples

- Software developers
- Managers
- Analysts
- Consultants
- Designers
- Scientists
- Lawyers
- Doctors

## HUMAN COGNITIVE LABOR^[Human cognitive labor refers to tasks and functions that require human intellectual processes, such as thinking, understanding, learning, and problem-solving. While physical labor is centered on manual and bodily tasks, cognitive labor emphasizes mental processes and the application of knowledge. ]


**Aspects of human cognitive labor:**

1. **Problem Solving**: Identifying complex issues and reviewing related information to develop and evaluate options and implement solutions.
2. **Decision Making**: Considering the relative costs and benefits of potential actions to choose the most appropriate one.
3. **Analysis**: Examining data or information and breaking it down to understand its structure, trends, or implications.
4. **Learning and Adaptation**: Acquiring new knowledge and skills and adjusting to new information or circumstances.
5. **Creativity**: Generating new ideas, concepts, or solutions.
6. **Planning**: Determining how a system or operation should work and how changes in conditions, operations, and environments will affect outcomes.
7. **Communication**: Conveying information effectively, both verbally and in writing. This also includes the ability to listen and understand information from others.
8. **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizing, understanding, and managing our own emotions while also recognizing, understanding, and influencing the emotions of others.

## SOME EXAMPLES

- Here is a contract and our contract guidelines. Review and red-line the contract.

- Does this Animal Care protocol conform to the federal guidelines?

- I have a fever and a cough. What is wrong with me?

- Gather data from these documents and summarize/analyze it.

- How does this job applicant align with the needs described in our job description?

**These [tasks]{.blue} are difficult to automate because their inputs are complex, unstructured, and highly variable.  They require human Cognitive Labor.**

## AUTOMATION OF COGNITIVE LABOR

"The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed."

- William Gibson ^[He made this observation to highlight how technological advancements and innovations might be present in certain places or among specific groups, but they haven't yet permeated all levels of society or all geographic areas. The quote encapsulates the idea that the future, in many ways, exists in pockets in the present, but its widespread adoption and distribution are yet to occur.]

## Large Language Models

https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/

Why are Large Language Models Important? Historically, AI models had been focused on perception and understanding. However, large language models, which are trained on internet-scale datasets with hundreds of billions of parameters, have now unlocked an AI model's ability to generate human-like content. Models can read, write, code, draw, and create in a credible fashion and augment human creativity and improve productivity across industries to solve the world's toughest problems. The applications for these LLMs span across a plethora of use cases. For example, an AI system can learn the language of protein sequences to provide viable compounds that will help scientists develop groundbreaking, life-saving vaccines. Or computers can help humans do what they do best---be creative, communicate, and create. A writer suffering from writer's block can use a large language model to help spark their creativity. Or a software programmer can be more productive, leveraging LLMs to generate code based on natural language descriptions.

## Latent Content and Emergent Properties

## Blooms Taxonomy

A hierarchical model to classify educational learning objectives into varying complexity and specificity. Remembering: Recalling facts and concepts. Retrieval and regurgitation Understanding: Explaining ideas and concepts. Connecting words to meanings. Applying: Using information in new situations. Functional utility Analyzing: Drawing connections among ideas. Connecting the dots between concepts. Evaluating: Justifying a decision or action. Explication and articulation Creating: Producing new or original work. Generating something that did not previously exist.

## Latent Content

Knowledge, facts, concepts, and information that is "embedded" in the model and must be "activated" by correct prompting. Training Data: Latent content only originates from training data. World Knowledge: General facts and understanding of the world. Scientific Information: Embedded data on scientific principles. Cultural Knowledge: Information on cultures and social norms. Historical Knowledge: Data on past events and figures. Languages: Language structures, vocabulary, and syntax.

## Emergent Capabilities

Increasingly large models have "emergent" capabilities that are not explicitly in the training data. Theory of Mind: Understanding the content of minds. It's read enough Reddit to understand how humans think. Implied Cognition: Thinking with the right prompting. Ability to "think" required to accurately predict next token. Logical Reasoning: Inductive and deductive reasoning. Triangulating principles based on observations, etc In-Context Learning: Use information not in training. Quickly adopt and apply truly novel information

## Hallucination

Hallucination is the same cognitive behavior as creativity, differing only in recognition of its fictitious nature. Recognition: The key difference lies in acknowledging the fictitious element. Cognitive Behavior: Both involve similar mental processes for generating ideas. Fictitious vs Real: How the output is perceived or utilized. Creative Applications: Hallucinations can be channeled into artistic or innovative endeavors. Context-Dependent: The value or risk depends on the context in which it occurs.

## Applying this in the workplace

## Data-Centric Model

1.  Treat all business processes and tasks as information problems

<!-- -->

a.  You have various information needs for each process or task
b.  Information comes from various sources
c.  You perform different transformations on the information

<!-- -->

2.  Information, Thy God

<!-- -->

a.  Data is the new oil
b.  AI is just a tool to work on data and information
c.  Keep it all

<!-- -->

3.  Types of Transformations

<!-- -->

a.  Shrinking: Summarization, extraction, classification
b.  Translation: Changing from one format to another
c.  Expanding: Brainstorming, synthesizing, drafting

## Human Cognitive Labor

Inputs -\> Human -\> Outputs

Inputs: Email, phonecall, document, spreadsheet, graph, etc...

Human -\> word, excel, email, powerpoint, etc

Outputs: an invoice? structured data? an email? a spreadsheet? a graph?

Interface: Where does this go? How do you know it is accurate?

## Assembly Lines

Think of all business tasks and work products as moving along an assembly line 1. Inputs a. Where do work items come from? b. Email, calls, bills, API calls? 2. Stations a. Who does what to the work item? b. What tools, data, information, and transformations are needed at each station? 3. Interfaces a. When is a work item handed off to the next station? b. Is it inside or outside the business? c. How do you know its ready? 4. Outputs a. Where does the work item go? What does it look like? b. A bill gets paid, a customer gets served, etc
