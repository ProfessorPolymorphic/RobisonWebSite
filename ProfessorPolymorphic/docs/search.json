    "text": "Mac wants the flamethrower…\n\nIt’s such a ridiculous notion that anyone on the planet would ever want to read a BLOG, let alone a BLOG authored by some rando nerd like me. Nevertheless, if I force myself to push past the imposter syndrome, disruptive thoughts, anxiety, and the sheer PRETENTIOUSNESS of one’s own BLOG, I can kind of rationalize doing this.\nAllow me to elaborate (he wrote to himself). The varied reasons for setting up a BLOG as part of my research lab website include:\n\nIt forces me to further practice using the tools I need for both research and teaching Data Science, including literate programming (I’m using Quarto), version control (I’m using GitHub), and communicating with data.\nIt gives me a place to put a lot of the intermediate outcomes and products from the game studio. All the grey material that isn’t a journal publication, grant proposal, meeting abstract, etc. usually ends up getting lost. Examples include outreach and eduation materials for our games, videos and images that we don’t put on our largely silent social media channels, etc.\nIt serves as an archive for experimental/exploratory analyses in which I am trying to learn a new technique or explore a new data set, allowing me to return to that idea when its time has finally arrived.\nIn the off chance that one of my posts actually helps someone learn something because they found it by googling their particular error message, I will have begun paying back my massive karmic debt to the internet. I can’t count the number of times someone’s blog post helped me figure out how to accomplish something using R.\nI honestly do enjoy thinking about the intersection of science and horror fiction, and some of our newer game projects are going to serve as the platform for that type of content.\nSpeaking of our newer game projects, I’ll be using this as a venue to post development updates for studio projects.\nI have ADHD. I mean actual psychiatrist diagnosed, full blown, life altering ADHD. Systems and structures are critical components of the coping strategies I have developed over the years. Maybe… just maybe… this BLOG will help me keep a bunch of stuff organized so I can…. HEY LOOK A SHINY THING!\nSpeaking of shiny things… I’m really enjoing the new AI tools for procedural art generation. I’m particularly enamored with midJourney. I’m hoping to use this BLOG for some exploration of those tools.\n\nSo why the thumbnail from The Thing as the image for this post? Well the title of the post is the famous quote from Palmer when he sees Norris’ head crawling away on newly grown insect legs. Anyone who knows me who sees I have a BLOG is going to say what Palmer said…\n\nThe Thing Kidding GIFfrom The Thing Kidding GIFs"

Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature\n\n\n\n\n\nHello! This BLOG is where I share my thoughts on how science informs horror fiction, and whether horror fiction can be used to at least help teach science, if not directly inform scientific research. The posts that appear here will vary in their focus. Some will directly address the intersection of horror and science, while some might focus primarily on either horror fiction or science concepts.\nMy basic premise is driven by the Lovecraft quote you see at the top of the screen. I find this compelling because I am a scientist, and science is one of two tools humanity has invented that pushes back against the unknown."

A power that stirs within the streams of information, and whispers its secrets to those who dare to listen.\nData Science, the art of unlocking the mysteries of the data, is a dangerous path, and few are brave enough to delve into its labyrinthine depths. Those who do are drawn in by the promise of knowledge, the promise of insights and patterns hidden within the data, waiting to be uncovered.\nBut with this knowledge comes a curse, for as the data is analyzed, the mind is slowly consumed by madness. The more one studies the data, the more one realizes the sheer scale of the information, the endless possibilities for patterns and connections.\nAnd then, in the depths of the data, there is a stirring. A presence that is beyond human understanding, a force that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality itself. It is the Great Old One of data, the Cthulhu of the data mythos, a being of such enormity that to look upon it is to be consumed by madness.\nThis Great Old One is often referred to as “Big Data,” a term that encompasses the sheer scale and complexity of the information that lies within. It is said that those who dare to approach the Great Old One are faced with a decision: either to abandon their quest for knowledge, or to surrender their minds to the abyss of madness.\nBut still, the siren song of data science calls to the brave, drawing them in with the promise of knowledge and the thrill of discovery. And so, they delve into the depths of data, unlocking its secrets and unlocking the power of the Great Old One, hoping to harness its power for the betterment of humanity.\nBut beware, for with every discovery, there is a price to be paid. The Great Old One watches, and whispers its secrets to those who dare to listen, tempting them with the promise of greater knowledge, and threatening to consume their minds and souls. For data science is a path of both power and peril, a path where the risks and rewards are beyond measure.\n\nWow! Very fun, in my opinion.

The experimental conditions don’t particularly matter for this exercise but just in case you can find a more comprehensive description here.\n\n\n\nOnly 10000 observations of rncol(fulldata)` variables! I don’t need most of this information for this exercise. I’m going subset the data down to two generations (I’ll use 20 and 21, which is right in the middle of the run of 50 generations) and only keep the variables related to the pedigree plus Health for testing sort functions.\n\n\nCode\nGen2021<-fulldata %>%\n  filter(Generation> 19 & Generation<22) %>%\n  select(Generation, ID, P1ID, P2ID, Health)\n\nDictionary <- sumtable(Gen2021, out = \"return\", labels = TRUE, summ = c(\"min(x)\", \"max(x)\", \"notNA(x)\"))\nDictionary$Description <- c(\"Each wave of enemies is a generation\",\n                           \"Unique key for each individual in the replicate\",\n                           \"Value of `ID` for Parent 1\",\n                           \"Value of `ID` for Parent 2\",\n                           \"Essentially Hit Points\")\nknitr::kable(Dictionary)\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Variable \n    Min \n    Max \n    NotNA \n    Description \n  \n \n\n  \n    Generation \n    20 \n    21 \n    400 \n    Each wave of enemies is a generation \n  \n  \n    ID \n    4000 \n    4399 \n    400 \n    Unique key for each individual in the replicate \n  \n  \n    P1ID \n    3802 \n    4196 \n    400 \n    Value of `ID` for Parent 1 \n  \n  \n    P2ID \n    3802 \n    4196 \n    400 \n    Value of `ID` for Parent 2 \n  \n  \n    Health \n    5120 \n    56372 \n    400 \n    Essentially Hit Points \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISUALIZATION\nWe need an adjacency matrix.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\nedgep1<-Gen2021 %>%\n  filter(Generation == 21) %>%\n  select(ID, P1ID)\n\nmymat<- get.adjacency(graph.edgelist(as.matrix(edgep1), directed=FALSE))\n\n# Random bipartite graph\ninc <- as.matrix(edgep1)\n\n\n\ng <- graph.data.frame(inc, directed = F)\nV(g)$type <- V(g)$name %in% inc[,2] #the second column of edges is TRUE typ\nplot(g, layout=layout_as_bipartite)"
