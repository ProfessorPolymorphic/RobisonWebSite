The focus was on a broad education covering arts, humanities, sciences, history, politics, and commerce. Universal Man: Goal of creating well-rounded, worldly individuals. Upper Echelons: Aimed at preparing students for societal leadership. (Ivy League still does this, btw) Broad Education: Covering arts, humanities, sciences. Highly cultured! Understanding History and Politics: To make informed contributions. Commerce Knowledge: To navigate and influence the economic landscape.",

One of the primary reasons companies outsource is to achieve cost reductions. Labor, infrastructure, or operational costs might be lower in another location or with a specialized provider.\nThe term originally comes from the military context, but it has been widely adopted in business, technology, and other fields to describe a factor that dramatically amplifies the effectiveness of a group or system.",
