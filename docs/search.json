We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\nCanvas Page\nCourse WebPage"

    "text": "Evolutionary Video Games\nIn 2015, Terry Soule and I co-founded Polymorphic Games, an experimental game studio that makes evolution based video games. Our original concept was that a model of biological evolution would make a great game mechanic. We observed that traditional video games were usually scripted, featuring “waves” of enemies with defined and predictable characteristics. A player’s success in such games is based on learning the predictable, rote script necessary to advance to subsequent levels. By integrating principles of evolutionary biology, we suspected that video games could be made more compelling. For example, by replacing the traditional waves of enemies with generations of enemies we could introduce adaptation through natural selection. If you want to learn more about our approach, scroll down to the section on Video Games and STEM Education.\nSince 2015 we have commercially released two evolutionary video games on Steam, and developed many other interactive simulations and outreach exhibits.\n\nCommercial Releases\n\nDarwin’s Demons is an arcade style space shooter in which you battle a population of evolving aliens. The alien’s morphology, fire type, and behaviors are all encoded by a digital genome. The aliens that are best able to shoot or evade you reproduce to make the next generation.\n\nProject Hastur is an evolutionary tower defense game. Defend humanity against the ever changing threat of the alien Proteans. Project Hastur combines elements of 3D tower defense and real-time strategy with models of biological evolution to create a uniquely challenging experience."

    "text": "Video Games and STEM Education\n\nAdding Evolution to Video Games\nThe best way to explain the concept is to frame our video games in the context of the “ingredients” of evolution:\n\nVariation\nInheritance\nSelection\nTime\n\nWhen these components are present, it leads to Adaptation.\n\nVariation\nThink about the enemies in the old school video games that I used to play in arcades. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest, etc. What kinds of variation can you descripbe in these enemies? In Space Invaders, you had three types of aliens in each wave, plus the occassional bonus flying saucer. In Centipede and Tempest, you actually had categorically different enemy types that varied in how they looked and in their capabilities.\n\nSpace InvadersCentipedeTempest\n\n\n Enemy variation in Space Invaders includes the shape of each alien type (four types), but also their position in the armada (each type has its own row) and their speed of movement (which is adjusted based on how many remain in each wave). For our purposes, we will ignore the flying saucer that occassionally passes across the top of the screen. The game increases in difficulty by having the movement speed of each wave increase. Ironically, the increased movement speed of the aliens within a wave as the population size was reduced was actually an unintended function of the increased frame rate achieved by having fewer aliens to draw on the screen.\n\n\nCentipede includes enemy types with very different behaviors and abilities. The segmented centipede can split into component parts. Fleas drop vertically, leave a trail of mushrooms, and take two hits to destroy. Spiders move in a diagonal zig zag pattern. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and turn mushrooms poisonous. Each wave the game difficulty increases by changing the behavior and segment number of the centipede.\nhttps://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2020/08/the-characters-of-centipede.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis variation is a big part of what makes video games exciting. The difficulty in video games is usually increased over time by introducing new variations of enemies, changing the enemies’ capabilities (like speed or fire rate) over time, or increasing the number of enemies. The problem (as we see it) is that these variations are introduced as part of a script that is programmed and balanced by the game developers.\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nSelection\n\n\nTime\nWe reasoned that playing these types of games might have implications for STEM education. The success of the player is based on her comprehension and application of principles of evolutionary biology. The parallels to real world examples are numerous, and include the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens, adaptation of crop pests to chemical and biological control measures, and behavioral adaptation to captivity in domesticated animals.\nAdding biological evolution to video games makes the games better for the game player and facilitates player comprehension of complex concepts that are hard to teach."

    "section": "Behavioral Genomics and Adaptation to Captivity",
    "text": "Behavioral Genomics and Adaptation to Captivity\n The process of adaptation to captivity can cause striking changes in a variety of behavioral phenotypes, including aggressive, feeding, and reproductive behaviors. However, some of the most profound and consistent evolutionary changes occur in behaviors related to fearfulness and anxiety, with domesticated animals often described as less fearful than their wild progenitor populations. The evolution of reduced fearfulness during captivity has been observed in a variety of vertebrate taxa, including mammals (Harri et al., 2003), birds (Jensen & Andersson, 2005), and fish (Johnsson & Abrahams, 1991; Robison & Rowland, 2005). Despite the prevalence of behavioral evolution during adaptation to captivity, we know surprisingly little about the underlying genetic changes that occur during domestication. What kinds of molecular variation (amino acid sequence, regulatory, or non coding RNA) are associated with variation in fear and anxiety related behaviors? What kinds of genes are typically changed in response to domestication selection? Are the apparently parallel changes in behavior across independent domestication events reflective of parallel molecular evolution, or does domestication result from myriad molecular routes to the same phenotypic endpoint? The answers to these questions are important in many contexts, including the study of the molecular mechanisms of behavioral evolution, the genetic basis of complex behaviors, and the effective conservation of captively reared species.\nWe use the zebrafish to study the genetic basis of fear related behaviors that commonly change during domestication in fish. The zebrafish is an excellent system for this purpose, combining a robust genomics toolset with superior experimental tractability. Our lab has documented variation among wild and laboratory derived strains consistent with the effects of domestication. The behavioral variation among wild and domesticated strains can be seen in the video on this page. This video shows two tanks of zebrafish randomly pulled from our zebrafish colony. One tank contains a highly domesticated (>30 generations) strain (Scientific Hatcheries), and the other tank contains a strain with a more recent history (~5 generations) of domestication (Nadia). We have quantified surface orientation (Robison and Rowland 2005, Benner et al 2010), observer orientation (Benner et al 2010), feeding latency (Oswald and Robison 2008), and open field behavior (Oswald and Robison in review) in these strains, and shown that they vary markedly in these anxiety related behaviors.\nWe use a variety of genomics approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive behavioral adaptation to captivity. We have compared the brain transcriptomes of wild and domesticated strains using both microarray platforms and Illumina and 454 based RNAseq. We have discovered many promising candidate genes that appear to differentiate behaviorally bold and behaviorally shy animals. We have also used RNAseq approaches to identify more than 20,000 SNPs that vary among our zebrafish strains. We are currently using these SNPs for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses.\nWe also combine these genomics approaches with quantitative genetics experiments. Mary Oswald, a recent Ph.D. graduate from our lab, has performed selection experiments on observer orientation. She has shown that these fear related behaviors have a significant genetic basis and are genetically correlated. Her selection experiment is now being continued by Matt Singer, who is a current Ph.D."

    "text": "The idea of Literate Programming is that source code that is executed as part of the program’s purpose is interspersed with documentation that describes the program’s logic. The concept of literate programming was first articulated by David Knuth in 1984. You know… back when music was good? Modern Data Science leans pretty heavily on literate programming, and to be honest, there aren’t very many good arguments as to why you WOULDN’T want to implement this approach in your own work. Bearing this in mind, we will adopt this framework for most of the activities, exercises, and assignments in this course. All of us will benefit by practicing these skills."

    "text": "LITERATE PROGRAMMING PUBLISHING SYSTEMS\nI’m trying to keep this course as technology agnostic as I can. The idea is that you should be practicing and building competencies in the languages and algorithms that are most useful to you. Who am I to tell you to use R instead of Python? If you have skills in a particular language I encourage you to keep using that during this course. That being said, I am going to work the examples using R and R Studio, and I will (mostly) use Quarto as the literate programming framework.\nIf all of this is new to you, no problem. Just follow along in R and Quarto and start your skill building journey with those languages.\nIf you are a python person, great! Quarto can accomodate that language as well. If you have another preference for literate programming, such as sticking with R Markdown until the Quarto bugs are fixed, that is great. Find the framework and tools that work for you, and practice, practice, practice!\n\nQuarto\nAn open source publishing system that allows you to create websites, documents, blogs, books, publications, presentations, and more while using R, Python, Julia, or Observable. Quarto is intended to be the more functional successor of R Markdown. I intend to use Quarto for most of my work in this course.\n\n\nR Markdown\nAnother publishing system for creating all the things … websites, slides, manuscripts, dashboards, etc. While most people (including me!) instinctively think of R and Python within R Markdown, the list of supported language engines is pretty extensive.\n\nnames(knitr::knit_engines$get())\n\n [1] \"awk\"       \"bash\"      \"coffee\"    \"gawk\"      \"groovy\"    \"haskell\"  \n [7] \"lein\"      \"mysql\"     \"node\"      \"octave\"    \"perl\"      \"php\"      \n[13] \"psql\"      \"Rscript\"   \"ruby\"      \"sas\"       \"scala\"     \"sed\"      \n[19] \"sh\"        \"stata\"     \"zsh\"       \"asis\"      \"asy\"       \"block\"    \n[25] \"block2\"    \"bslib\"     \"c\"         \"cat\"       \"cc\"        \"comment\"  \n[31] \"css\"       \"ditaa\"     \"dot\"       \"embed\"     \"eviews\"    \"exec\"     \n[37] \"fortran\"   \"fortran95\" \"go\"        \"highlight\" \"js\"        \"julia\"    \n[43] \"python\"    \"R\"         \"Rcpp\"      \"sass\"      \"scss\"      \"sql\"      \n[49] \"stan\"      \"targets\"   \"tikz\"      \"verbatim\"  \"ojs\"       \"mermaid\"  \n[55] \"include\""

    "section": "LANGUAGES AND TOOLSETS",
    "text": "LANGUAGES AND TOOLSETS\nThere are quite a few, but the five that seemed to keep coming up as I prepped this course are:\n\nR\nA very powerful open source framework for statistical computing and graphics. R has a lot of base functionality, and its capabilities are increased by 100 fold with packages created by R users. Packages are the core units of R code. I’m going to use R for the vast majority of demonstrations in this course.\n\n\nPython\nPython is an open source general purpose programming language. It wasn’t developed just for statistical computing or data science, and people use this language for tons of different applications. There is no denying it has become a very powerful language for data science and data visualization.\n\n\nTableau\nTableau is proprietary software that is very powerful for creating beautiful and functional data visualizations. It can integrate with all sorts of data sources and is used a lot for analytics, especially in the business world. The downsides (that occur to me at least) are that it costs money, it is not open source, and is more of a one-trick-pony than the programming languages on this list.\n\n\nJavascript\nJavascript has been around for about 25 years, and is (I think) the world’s most popular programming language. Along with HTML and CSS, Javascript drives pretty much the entire internet. I mention Javascript here because it has the D3 library, which can create super cool interactive data visualizaitons. In my experience, the learning curve with Javascript and D3 was pretty steep. I bought a book about it once, but just haven’t been able to allocate the amount of time necessary to really start using it. Check out the gallery of examples. Amazing!\n\n\nObservable / D3\nObservable is a set of extensions to Javascript that features something called reactive runtime. This means that the code blocks are executed and compiled as they are written, and changes are implemented instantaneously. Observable is pretty great for data exploration, and is well supported by Quarto. In addition, you can use the Observable JS libraries in Quarto to access D3. We’ll use some of these tools in this course, especially when we start considering interactivity."

These simple precautions go a long way in reducing the impact of coronavirus on our campuses and in our communities. With everyone engaging in these small actions, we can continue to participate in our vibrant campus culture where we are able to learn, live, and grow. Please bookmark the University of Idaho Covid-19 webpage and visit it often for the most up-to-date information about the U of I’s response to Covid-19.\n\nAll classes are offered in the modality listed in the catalog.\nAll Vandals are highly encouraged to be vaccinated.\nCOVID-19 tests are not required to attend class in person.\n\nAdditionally, faculty and students must follow the Healthy Vandal Pledge: Daily Symptom Monitoring and In-Person Class Attendance. Evaluate your own health status before attending in-person classes and refrain from attending class in-person if you are ill, if you are experiencing any of the known symptoms of Coronavirus, or if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been potentially exposed to someone with COVID-19. Stay home if you experience any symptoms related to COVID 19 and that are not attributed to a non-infectious health condition regardless of how mild. Contact your medical provider or local Idaho Public Health District for assessment of symptoms and possible COVID19 testing. Positive COVID 19 tests should be submitted via a VandalCare Report in order to make arrangements that involve classroom absences due to illness, and/or quarantine or isolation requirements directed by a medical provider.\n\n\nATTENDANCE POLICY\nMissing a scheduled lecture is at your discretion. I will be posting all the lecture notes online, and recording the lectures for future online versions of the course. I have no intention of offering a zoom option this semester. If a discussion or in-class exercise occurs and you miss it, you will lose those participation points. There is no way to make up those points.\n\n\nLATE ARRIVAL OF PROFESSOR POLICY\nThe R Markdown template I used for this syllabus was created by Dr. Steven V. Miller at Stockholm University. It contained this section, which I found amusing and have therefore retained. Professor Miller’s current university asks professors to have policies written into their syllabus about what students should do if the professor is more than 15 minutes late to class. Here is my version of that policy:\nI will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if class is cancelled for the day. Events that might create such a scenario include travel obligations that emerged after the semester has begun, a family emergency that encompasses multiple days, or some other thing. I will also contact our department secretary in emergent situations, such as something happening on the way to work. Failing that, assume the worst. Alien abduction, the return of one or more Old Ones to our plane, or some kind of attack by wizards are all viable explanations for my inability to attend class. I ask that the students make sure that my story gets the proper treatment on the “Mr. Ballen” YouTube channel. I also ask that my story be narrated by Morgan Freeman and that the role of me in the made for TV movie be played by Keanu Reeves or Danny DeVito.\n\n\nMAKE UP EXAM POLICY\nThe bad news is that there are NO make-ups for missed exams. Don’t bother asking. The good news is that there aren’t any exams.\n\n\nACADEMIC DISHONESTY POLICY\nAll students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. This includes but is not limited to: not cheating, not using the ideas of others without giving appropriate credit (including Wikipedia!), and not falsifying data. Any incident of academic dishonesty will be handled according to the guidelines of the University of Idaho."

I taught Genomics and General Genetics for 15 years, and I now teach various courses in Data Science as part of our new Graduate Certificate in Professional Applications of Data Science.\nI am the co-founder (along with Professor Terry Soule) of Polymorphic Games, an experimental video game studio that applies game development technology to scientific research and STEM education.\nI am the Director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Sciences (IIDS).\nFinally, I am a huge Horror and Science Fiction nerd. I am fascinated by the intersection of these genres with science, and I explore these intersections in my BLOG - Professor Polymorphic."

    "text": "Mac wants the flamethrower…\n\nIt’s such a ridiculous notion that anyone on the planet would ever want to read a BLOG, let alone a BLOG authored by some rando nerd like me. Nevertheless, if I force myself to push past the imposter syndrome, disruptive thoughts, anxiety, and the sheer PRETENTIOUSNESS of one’s own BLOG, I can kind of rationalize doing this.\nAllow me to elaborate (he wrote to himself). The varied reasons for setting up a BLOG as part of my research lab website include:\n\nIt forces me to further practice using the tools I need for both research and teaching Data Science, including literate programming (I’m using Quarto), version control (I’m using GitHub), and communicating with data.\nIt gives me a place to put a lot of the intermediate outcomes and products from the game studio. All the grey material that isn’t a journal publication, grant proposal, meeting abstract, etc. usually ends up getting lost. Examples include outreach and eduation materials for our games, videos and images that we don’t put on our largely silent social media channels, etc.\nIt serves as an archive for experimental/exploratory analyses in which I am trying to learn a new technique or explore a new data set, allowing me to return to that idea when its time has finally arrived.\nIn the off chance that one of my posts actually helps someone learn something because they found it by googling their particular error message, I will have begun paying back my massive karmic debt to the internet. I can’t count the number of times someone’s blog post helped me figure out how to accomplish something using R.\nI honestly do enjoy thinking about the intersection of science and horror fiction, and some of our newer game projects are going to serve as the platform for that type of content.\nSpeaking of our newer game projects, I’ll be using this as a venue to post development updates for studio projects.\nI have ADHD. I mean actual psychiatrist diagnosed, full blown, life altering ADHD. Systems and structures are critical components of the coping strategies I have developed over the years. Maybe… just maybe… this BLOG will help me keep a bunch of stuff organized so I can…. HEY LOOK A SHINY THING!\nSpeaking of shiny things… I’m really enjoing the new AI tools for procedural art generation. I’m particularly enamored with midJourney. I’m hoping to use this BLOG for some exploration of those tools.\n\nSo why the thumbnail from The Thing as the image for this post? Well the title of the post is the famous quote from Palmer when he sees Norris’ head crawling away on newly grown insect legs. Anyone who knows me who sees I have a BLOG is going to say what Palmer said…\n\nThe Thing Kidding GIFfrom The Thing Kidding GIFs"

Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature\nVideo\n\n\nHello! This BLOG is where I share my thoughts on how science informs horror fiction, and whether horror fiction can be used to at least help teach science, if not directly inform scientific research. The posts that appear here will vary in their focus. Some will directly address the intersection of horror and science, while some might focus primarily on either horror fiction or science concepts.\nMy basic premise is driven by the Lovecraft quote you see at the top of the screen. I find this compelling because I am a scientist, and science is one of two tools humanity has invented that pushes back against the unknown."
