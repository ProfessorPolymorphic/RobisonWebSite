Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\nCanvas Page\nCourse WebPage"

    "text": "Evolutionary Video Games\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Terry Soule and I co-founded Polymorphic Games, an experimental game studio that makes evolution based video games. Our original concept was that a model of biological evolution would make a great game mechanic. We observed that traditional video games were usually scripted, featuring “waves” of enemies with defined and predictable characteristics. A player’s success in such games is based on learning the predictable, rote script necessary to advance to subsequent levels. By integrating principles of evolutionary biology, we suspected that video games could be made more compelling. For example, by replacing the traditional waves of enemies with generations of enemies we could introduce adaptation through natural selection. If you want to learn more about our approach, scroll down to the section on Video Games and STEM Education.\nSince 2015 we have commercially released two evolutionary video games on Steam, and developed many other interactive simulations and outreach exhibits.\n\nCommercial Releases\n\nDarwin’s Demons is an arcade style space shooter in which you battle a population of evolving aliens. The alien’s morphology, fire type, and behaviors are all encoded by a digital genome. The aliens that are best able to shoot or evade you reproduce to make the next generation.\n\nProject Hastur is an evolutionary tower defense game. Defend humanity against the ever changing threat of the alien Proteans. Project Hastur combines elements of 3D tower defense and real-time strategy with models of biological evolution to create a uniquely challenging experience."

    "text": "Video Games and STEM Education\n\nAdding Evolution to Video Games\nThe best way to explain the concept is to frame our video games in the context of the “ingredients” of evolution:\n\nVariation\nInheritance\nSelection\nTime\n\nWhen these components are present, it leads to Adaptation.\n\nVariation\nThink about the enemies in the old school video games that I used to play in arcades. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest, etc. What kinds of variation can you descripbe in these enemies? In Space Invaders, you had three types of aliens in each wave, plus the occassional bonus flying saucer. In Centipede and Tempest, you actually had categorically different enemy types that varied in how they looked and in their capabilities.\n\nSpace InvadersCentipedeTempest\n\n\n Enemy variation in Space Invaders includes the shape of each alien type (four types), but also their position in the armada (each type has its own row) and their speed of movement (which is adjusted based on how many remain in each wave). For our purposes, we will ignore the flying saucer that occassionally passes across the top of the screen. The game increases in difficulty by having the movement speed of each wave increase. Ironically, the increased movement speed of the aliens within a wave as the population size was reduced was actually an unintended function of the increased frame rate achieved by having fewer aliens to draw on the screen.\n\n\nCentipede includes enemy types with very different behaviors and abilities. The segmented centipede can split into component parts. Fleas drop vertically, leave a trail of mushrooms, and take two hits to destroy. Spiders move in a diagonal zig zag pattern. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and turn mushrooms poisonous. Each wave the game difficulty increases by changing the behavior and segment number of the centipede.\nhttps://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2020/08/the-characters-of-centipede.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis variation is a big part of what makes video games exciting. The difficulty in video games is usually increased over time by introducing new variations of enemies, changing the enemies’ capabilities (like speed or fire rate) over time, or increasing the number of enemies. The problem (as we see it) is that these variations are introduced as part of a script that is programmed and balanced by the game developers.\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nSelection\n\n\nTime\nWe reasoned that playing these types of games might have implications for STEM education. The success of the player is based on her comprehension and application of principles of evolutionary biology. The parallels to real world examples are numerous, and include the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens, adaptation of crop pests to chemical and biological control measures, and behavioral adaptation to captivity in domesticated animals.\nAdding biological evolution to video games makes the games better for the game player and facilitates player comprehension of complex concepts that are hard to teach."

    "section": "Behavioral Genomics and Adaptation to Captivity",
    "text": "Behavioral Genomics and Adaptation to Captivity\n The process of adaptation to captivity can cause striking changes in a variety of behavioral phenotypes, including aggressive, feeding, and reproductive behaviors. However, some of the most profound and consistent evolutionary changes occur in behaviors related to fearfulness and anxiety, with domesticated animals often described as less fearful than their wild progenitor populations. The evolution of reduced fearfulness during captivity has been observed in a variety of vertebrate taxa, including mammals (Harri et al., 2003), birds (Jensen & Andersson, 2005), and fish (Johnsson & Abrahams, 1991; Robison & Rowland, 2005). Despite the prevalence of behavioral evolution during adaptation to captivity, we know surprisingly little about the underlying genetic changes that occur during domestication. What kinds of molecular variation (amino acid sequence, regulatory, or non coding RNA) are associated with variation in fear and anxiety related behaviors? What kinds of genes are typically changed in response to domestication selection? Are the apparently parallel changes in behavior across independent domestication events reflective of parallel molecular evolution, or does domestication result from myriad molecular routes to the same phenotypic endpoint? The answers to these questions are important in many contexts, including the study of the molecular mechanisms of behavioral evolution, the genetic basis of complex behaviors, and the effective conservation of captively reared species.\nWe use the zebrafish to study the genetic basis of fear related behaviors that commonly change during domestication in fish. The zebrafish is an excellent system for this purpose, combining a robust genomics toolset with superior experimental tractability. Our lab has documented variation among wild and laboratory derived strains consistent with the effects of domestication. The behavioral variation among wild and domesticated strains can be seen in the video on this page. This video shows two tanks of zebrafish randomly pulled from our zebrafish colony. One tank contains a highly domesticated (>30 generations) strain (Scientific Hatcheries), and the other tank contains a strain with a more recent history (~5 generations) of domestication (Nadia). We have quantified surface orientation (Robison and Rowland 2005, Benner et al 2010), observer orientation (Benner et al 2010), feeding latency (Oswald and Robison 2008), and open field behavior (Oswald and Robison in review) in these strains, and shown that they vary markedly in these anxiety related behaviors.\nWe use a variety of genomics approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive behavioral adaptation to captivity. We have compared the brain transcriptomes of wild and domesticated strains using both microarray platforms and Illumina and 454 based RNAseq. We have discovered many promising candidate genes that appear to differentiate behaviorally bold and behaviorally shy animals. We have also used RNAseq approaches to identify more than 20,000 SNPs that vary among our zebrafish strains. We are currently using these SNPs for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses.\nWe also combine these genomics approaches with quantitative genetics experiments. Mary Oswald, a recent Ph.D. graduate from our lab, has performed selection experiments on observer orientation. She has shown that these fear related behaviors have a significant genetic basis and are genetically correlated. Her selection experiment is now being continued by Matt Singer, who is a current Ph.D."

That being said, I am going to work the examples using R and R Studio, and I will (mostly) use Quarto as the literate programming framework.\nIf all of this is new to you, no problem. Just follow along in R and Quarto and start your skill building journey with those languages.\nIf you are a python person, great! Quarto can accomodate that language as well.

    "text": "LANGUAGES AND TOOLSETS\nThere are quite a few, but the five that seemed to keep coming up as I prepped this course are:\n\nR\nA very powerful open source framework for statistical computing and graphics. R has a lot of base functionality, and its capabilities are increased by 100 fold with packages created by R users. Packages are the core units of R code. I’m going to use R for the vast majority of demonstrations in this course.\n\n\nPython\nPython is an open source general purpose programming language. It wasn’t developed just for statistical computing or data science, and people use this language for tons of different applications. There is no denying it has become a very powerful language for data science and data visualization.\n\n\nTableau\nTableau is proprietary software that is very powerful for creating beautiful and functional data visualizations. It can integrate with all sorts of data sources and is used a lot for analytics, especially in the business world. The downsides (that occur to me at least) are that it costs money, it is not open source, and is more of a one-trick-pony than the programming languages on this list.\n\n\nJavascript\nJavascript has been around for about 25 years, and is (I think) the world’s most popular programming language. Along with HTML and CSS, Javascript drives pretty much the entire internet. I mention Javascript here because it has the D3 library, which can create super cool interactive data visualizaitons. In my experience, the learning curve with Javascript and D3 was pretty steep. I bought a book about it once, but just haven’t been able to allocate the amount of time necessary to really start using it. Check out the gallery of examples. Amazing!\n\n\nObservable / D3\nObservable is a set of extensions to Javascript that features something called reactive runtime. This means that the code blocks are executed and compiled as they are written, and changes are implemented instantaneously. Observable is pretty great for data exploration, and is well supported by Quarto. In addition, you can use the Observable JS libraries in Quarto to access D3. We’ll use some of these tools in this course, especially when we start considering interactivity."

Then I want you to recreate the classic figure from Anscombe’s Quartet.\nNow, you might be asking…\n“How am I supposed to do that? You haven’t taught me how to do anything yet!”\nHere is the dirty little secret of modern education.\nThe Internet Exists.\nWhile I could use up an entire 90 minute lecture telling you how to:\ndownload and install R, R-Studio, and Quarto\ncreate a Quarto document that will publish in the .html format\ninstall the R packages you will need\ntidy up the Anscombe’s Quartet data\ncalculate the summary statistics for each x y pair\nand make a nice little plot…\nI’m not going to do that.\nInstead, I want you to use the resources I point towards, or other resources that make more sense to you, to figure out how to do those things."

    "text": "// About\nThis class will help students establish a foundational understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n\n// Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASSIGNMENT 1 - Fun with literate programming.\n\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDataViz\n\n\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrie Robison\n\n\nDec 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLECTURE 1 - INTRO\n\n\n\nLecture\n\n\nDataViz\n\n\nIntro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrie Robison\n\n\nOct 16, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

We have released two evolutionary video games on Steam:\nDarwin’s Demons is an rcade style space shooter in which you battle a population of evolving aliens. The alien’s morphology, fire type, and behaviors are all encoded by a digital genome. The aliens that are best able to shoot or evade you reproduce to make the next generation.\nProject Hastur is an evolutionary tower defense game. Defend humanity against the ever changing threat of the alien Proteans. Project Hastur combines elements of 3D tower defense and real-time strategy with models of biological evolution to create a uniquely challenging experience.\nI am also a huge Horror and Science Fiction nerd, and am fascinated by the intersection of these genres with science."
