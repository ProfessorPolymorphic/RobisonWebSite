## LAST LECTURE

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help [people]{.red} carry out [tasks]{.red} more effectively.

![](frameworkbig.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" width="800"}

## WHAT?

![](what.png){.absolute bottom="0" height="400"} Before you design a visualization, you need to understand the [data]{.red}.  Here, we consider the [DATA TYPE]{.blue}, and the [DATA ATTRIBUTES]{.blue}.

## THE THREE MAJOR DATA TYPES

## THE HUMAN

**Why have a human in the loop?**

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help [people]{.red} carry out [tasks]{.red} more effectively.

-   We don't need visualization when a **trusted** fully automatic solution exists.

-   Visualization is suitable when there is a need to [augment human capabilities]{.red} rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.

## WHEN TO VISUALIZE

**Visualization is useful when:**

::: r-fit-text
-   The analysis problem is ill-specified and we don't know exactly what questions to ask in advance.
-   We are interested in long-term use for end users (ex: exploratory analysis of scientific data).
-   We are presenting known results (ex: [New York Times Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)).
-   We need a stepping stone to assess requirements before developing models.
-   Developers of an automatic solution want to refine & determine parameters.
-   We need to help end users of automatic solutions verify and build trust.

## THE REPRESENTATION

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

## WHY DEPEND ON VISION?

Computer-based visualization systems provide [visual representations]{.red} of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

::: r-fit-text
-   The human visual system is a high-bandwidth channel to the brain.
-   Overview is possible due to background processing, providing the subjective experience of seeing everything simultaneously.
-   Significant processing occurs in parallel and pre-attentively.
-   **What about sound?** lower bandwidth and different semantics, overview not supported, subjective experience of sequential stream.
-   **What about touch/haptics?** impoverished record/replay capacity, only very low-bandwidth communication thus far.
-   **What about taste, smell?** no viable record/replay devices.
:::

## WHY REPRESENT (ALL THE) DATA?

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of [datasets]{.red} designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

::: r-fit-text
-   summaries lose information
-   details matter
-   confirm expected and find unexpected patterns
-   assess validity of statistical model
-   ANSCOMBE'S QUARTET is a fun example that we shall use to illustrate these points!

## ANSCOMBE'S QUARTET

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fontsize: 2
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
datasets::anscombe
```

#### Anscombe's Quartet

The four x-y pairs have identical summary statistics.

```{r}
tidy_anscombe <- anscombe %>%
 pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
              names_to = c(".value", "set"),
              names_pattern = "(.)(.)")
tidy_anscombe_summary <- tidy_anscombe %>%
  group_by(set) %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = lst(min,max,median,mean,sd,var),
                   .names = "{col}_{fn}"))
#> `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

vars<-c("set", "x_mean", "x_var",  "y_mean", "y_var")
thing<- as.data.frame(tidy_anscombe_summary[vars])
knitr::kable(thing)
```

## VIZ MATTERS

```{r}
ggplot(tidy_anscombe,
       aes(x = x,
           y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = tidy_anscombe_summary, aes(x=x_mean, y = y_mean, color = "red", size = 5),
             show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~set) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## RESOURCE LIMITATIONS

Visualization designers must take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations:

-   Limitations of computers.
-   Limitations of humans.
-   Limitations of displays.

## COMPUTATIONAL LIMITS

CPU time

System Memory

## DISPLAY LIMITS

Pixels are precious and are the most constrained resource.

-   [Information Density]{.red}: ratio of space used to encode information vs unused whitespace.
-   There is a tradeoff between clutter and wasting space.
-   Designer must find the sweet spot between dense and sparse.

## HUMAN LIMITS

-   Time
-   Memory
-   Attention

## VISUALIZATION ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

### ANALYSIS?

-   imposes structure on huge design space.
-   scaffold to help you think systematically about choices.
-   analyzing existing designs serves as stepping stone to designing new visualizations.
-   most possibilities in a design space are ineffective for a particular task/data combination.

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
